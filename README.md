# Database-for-managing-a-hotel-chain

Project goal: Improving the efficiency of hotel operations and provide a better experience for customers.

Technologies used: SQL Server

Description of the model, its utility and operational rules:

-> The database will include some of the clients' personal and contact information.

-> For each guest, the system will keep track of the duration of their stay and the room they occupied. In case of any missing item from the room, the database will immediately identify the occupant and follow appropriate procedures.

-> The database will also contain information on the type of each room (2/3/4 persons, with double/queen/single beds).

-> The facilities available in each room will also be recorded in the database, allowing customers to choose their preferred room.

-> The database will contain information about all hotel employees, their job history, and the departments in which they work.
